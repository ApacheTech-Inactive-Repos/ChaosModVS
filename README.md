# Vintage Story ChaosMod

Chaos Mod VS is an attempt to mimic the Chaos mods found on Grand Theft Auto V, San Andreas, and Vice City.

Basically, every 60 seconds the game will trigger a random effect. This effect can be anything from giving you a few iron nuggets, to exploding all nearby animals or making every nearby drifter dance.

There are one-time and timed effects. One timed effects will run only once when the effect is started, while timed effects will run for between 30 and 120 seconds (by default) after they've been started.

This makes gameplay significantly more surprising, as literally anything could happen every time an effect starts.

The mod also comes with a simple configuration tool. You can do anything from changing how often an effect should start to toggling individual effects and changing all kind of settings individually for any effect.

Also this mod is open source and licensed with GPLv3. Feel free to do whatever you want with it as long as it doesn't violate the license in any way and you credit me accordingly.

**Please note: Some mods can conflict with some effects! If you are experiencing any problems try disabling all other mods before reporting them back!**

### Twitch / YouTube Integration

The mod comes with a Twitch Bot and YouTube Bot, which when installed, will allow your Twitch/YouTube chat to vote on which effects will come next, during livestreams.

A HTML based overlay will be displayed, with four options. By typing 1, 2, 3, or 4 into chat, an effect will be chosen, using percentage-based proportional representation. e.g. If an option receives 60% of the vote, it has a 60% chance of occuring.

A lot of options can be changed, and the bot also comes with a number of chat commands that viewers can use within your Twitch Channel.

Also included with the mod is a branding pack, which includes Vintage Story emotes for Twitch Subscribers, or YouTube Channel Members.

### Discord Integration

The mod comes packaged with a Discord Bot, that when installed, will integrate your Vintage Story gameworld with your Discord server. Notify Discord channels about player deaths, in-game chat messages, temporal storms, and more. Discord users can also send commands to game, to trigger effects. This works in much the same way as the Twitch, and YouTube Bots.
