## IOC Containers

Do I want to add AutoMapper as an IOC/DI Container?

Castle Windsor is probably a bit overkill, for the size of the project; and I don't think it would be sensible to use MEF as an IOC Container.

Are there any other contenders, around the level of AutoMapper, that would work for a project of this size?
