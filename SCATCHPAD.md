## IOC Containers

Do I want to add AutoMapper as an IOC/DI Container?

Castle Windsor is probably a bit overkill, for the size of the project; and I don't think it would be sensible to use MEF as an IOC Container.

Are there any other contenders, around the level of AutoMapper, that would work for a project of this size?

    Microsoft Unity (not to be confused with Unity Game Engine)

Is it possible to set up a dummy rig, so that we can do TDD on the middleware aspects of the mod?

How does TDD play with MEF? This is a million miles from FizzBuzz.
